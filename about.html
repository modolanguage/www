        <h1>Motivation</h1>
        <p>Information technologies provide solutions to make our lives easier. Some of them have little effect on our daily
          and profesional lives, where some can completely change them. Even further, internet makes these solutions, time
        and location free.</p>

        <p>This rapidly changing world of IT, emerges the need of robust, flexible and efficient software development methods
          and paradigms. These methods and paradigms should be easy to use, implement and integrate. In addition, these
          methods and paradigms should have the ability to adapt to the rapidly changing needs and technologies. Numerous
          studies have been made and several methods have been proposed. Today, these methods are being used by many of
        the professioanls of the IT and related fields.</p>

        <p>However the complex nature of the current methods requires technical knowledge in depth. This technical depth widens
        the gap between IT and the non-IT professionals.</p>

        <p>Moreover, with the increasing shift of systems to the online world, there still resides a need to have a semantic
        representation tool to model and convert real life systems to the world of computers.</p>

        <p>In order to address the above issues and more, we propose the Modo language.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="container scrollspy" id="divWhatisModo">
        <h1>What is Modo?</h1>
        <p>
          Modo is an easy-to-use modeling language which is used for modeling systems, their subsystems, super systems (the system
          that encompasses the system that is in focus) and environment. The simple syntax of Modo allows easy modeling
          for not only the IT professionals but also for the professionals from non-IT fields. The well-structured and
          machine-readable nature of Modo also allows direct conversion of the models to different programming languages
          and technologies, thus serving as a technology independent modeling method.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container scrollspy" id="divBriefHistory">
        <h1>Brief History</h1>
        <p>A significant part of software development can be described as an effort of modeling real-life systems, using the
          computer systems. Computer systems, which are more static, have structured (explicitly definite) or semi-structured
          nature. On the other hand real-life systems, which are more dynamic, can be structured, semi-structured or most
        of the time, unstructured.</p>

        <p>In the year 2005, a concept for software development was proposed by Aykut Ayd覺nl覺 to be used for the projects
          of Sanpark. The main idea of this concept was to isolate the analysis and the design of real-life systems from
          the boundaries of computer systems. With the help of this isolated analysis, the idle effort of modeling an unstructured
          real-life system into a computer system is avoided and the resulting computer system serves as a complete solution.
        Ensuring the computer system is designed for the real-life system; not vice-versa.</p>

        <p>The isolated analysis needs a method to model and define the real-life system. First real-life system definition
          was made using XML in the late 2005. This definition enabled isolated analysis of real-life systems, automated
          conversion to existing technologies, and initiated real-life system versioning. This first definition syntax
        was used by Sanpark for two years.</p>

        <p>In late 2007, after observing the short-comings of the previous syntax a new language, which does not use the XML
          syntax anymore, has been constructed for system definition and semantic representation. And there the Modo language
        was born. There were two main reasons for abandoning the XML syntax:</p>

        <ol class="collection">
          <li class="collection-item">XML syntax is not easily readable/writable for non-IT professionals and</li>
          <li class="collection-item">XML is not sufficient to declare systems' different conditions, modes and states for different time frames and/or
            conditions.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Modo's latest shape was given and the language specification was finalized by Aykut Ayd覺nl覺 and Doruk Eker in June,
          2009.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div class="container scrollspy" id="divTheNameModo">
        <h1>The Name Modo</h1>
        <p>The word "modo" means "mode" in Esperanto language. Esperanto language is a constructed (artificial) language.
          It is constructed to narrow the gap between people speaking different languages, having different cultures and
          having different beliefs.
        </p>
        <p>Similarly Modo language is constructed to narrow the gap between people from different disciplines, different technical
          expertise and different viewpoints.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container scrollspy" id="divZeroDefect">
        <h1>The Zero Defect Software</h1>
        <p>From a certain point of view, a software which is not serving the needs of the user can be considered as defected.
        This can be caused by one or both reasons listed below:</p>

        <ol class="collection">
          <li class="collection-item">There are coding errors (bugs) within the code of the software.</li>
          <li class="collection-item">The real-life system/problem related to the software was poorly or never analyzed, therefore the resulting computer
          system fails to serve the real-life system.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>One should overcome the above issues to get closer to the zero-defect software phenomenon.</p>

        <p>The first type of errors are the runtime errors, namely the bugs in the software. At every line of code developed,
          there is a certain probability of having something wrong. Therefore as the number of lines of code developed
          for a project/software increases, the probability of having an error also increases. Reducing the number of lines
          of code developed specifically for a software project reduces the number of errors. Code generators enable the
          reduction in number of lines of code. Once the initial bugs in the generator are fixed, in unit time the generated
        code becomes bug-free.</p>

        <p>Modo is designed to be well-structured and machine readable, and therefore it is possible to use generators to
        convert Modo models to different languages. With the help of this feature Modo addresses the runtime errors.</p>

        <p>The second type of errors is the design-time errors which are basically the errors that occur when analyzing the
          systems. The quality of the system analysis is directly related with the experience of the analyzer. However,
          even for the inexperienced analyzer, the design-time errors can be fixed with trial and error. The trial and
          error method can only be efficient if the time needed for each trial is affordable. The simple syntax of Modo
          combined with the rapid code generation, decreases the time needed to try different scenarios. Therefore enabling
        the trial and error process and addressing also the design-time errors.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="container scrollspy" id="divSemanticWebAndModo">
        <h1>Semantic Web and Modo</h1>
        <p>Every moment information technologies yield a large amount of information waiting for humans and systems to discover,
          filter, process and generate. As the amount of information increases, we have drastically less time to discover,
          filter and process this information. For this reason, no matter how precise and accurate a piece of information
          is, it starts to become meaningless, unless its meaning and relations can be understood and processed automatically
          by computers. Adding the meaning to any piece of information at its very source is the key solution for this
          problem. This ensures that the information is in the same format at any point of the system, hence the effort
          of all semantic web standards and specifications.
        </p>
        <p>A system which is modeled using Modo, is automatically represented at the semantic level. Different Modo models
          can include the required metadata for every piece of information to be delivered. This approach of Modo is aimed
          to be a contribution for the ongoing search of a common semantic definition method.
