# Modo Language Web Site

**Modo** is an easy-to-use modeling language which is used for modeling systems, their subsystems, super systems (the system that encompasses the system that is in focus) and environment. The simple syntax of Modo allows easy modeling for not only the IT professionals but also for the professionals from non-IT fields. The well-structured and machine-readable nature of Modo also allows direct conversion of the models to different programming languages and technologies, thus serving as a technology independent modeling method.
