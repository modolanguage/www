          <h1>Get Started</h1>
          <h2>Understand The System</h2>

          <p>The first step of achieving a realistic Modo model is to analyze and understand the system to be modeled as realistically
            as possible. It is not a time consuming effort to remodel the system using Modo. However a more realistic analysis
            will save you time to focus on the solution in deeper details.</p>

          <p>For the quick-start example, let's think of the registration system of a university.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container" id="divDefineMainElements">
          <h2>Define Main Elements</h2>
          <p>The registration system most likely has students, instructors and courses. Those can be considered as the main
            elements of that system, and below is how you represent them.
          </p>
          <div class="divCodePreview">
            <code>
                <pre style="background:#fff;color:#3b3b3b"><span style="color:#af82d4">/* Registration System Element Declarations */</span>
Student;
Instructor;
Course;
</pre>
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>As seen above the elements of a system can be declared that easily. However when you want to add the properties
            of those elements, it is better to use the below representation.
          </p>
          <div class="divCodePreview">
            <code>
                <pre style="background:#fff;color:#3b3b3b"><span style="color:#af82d4">/* Registration System Element Declarations */</span>
Student{
}
Instructor{
}
Course{
}
</pre>
            </code>
          </div>

          <p>It is the common practice to define singular elements, and let the frameworks handle the groups of those elements.
            That is why the above example defines <span class="spanCodeBit">Student</span>, <span class="spanCodeBit">Instructor</span>            and <span class="spanCodeBit">Course</span>, instead of <span class="spanCodeBit">Students</span>, <span class="spanCodeBit">Instructors</span>            and <span class="spanCodeBit">Courses</span>.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </div>
        <div class="container" id="divDefineMemberElements">
          <h2>Define Member Elements</h2>
          <p>The elements of the registration system have some properties in real-life. Like the name and surname of a student,
            like the ID of a course etc. Those properties are called <strong>member elements</strong> in Modo.</p>

          <div class="divCodePreview">
            <code>
                    <pre style="background:#fff;color:#3b3b3b">/* Registration System Element Declarations */
  Student {
      Name = String;
      Surname = String;
      ID = Number;
      GPA = Number;
  }
  
  Instructor {
      Name = String;
      Surname = String;
      ID = Number;
  }
  
  Course {
      Name = String;
      ID = Number;
      Instructor = Instructor;
  }
  </pre>
                </code>
          </div>
          <p>As you can see in the example above the member elements are defined within the curly brackets of the related element.
            The equal sign (=) is used to assign the types of the member elements. The types of the member elements can be
            built-in elements or other elements that are previously defined by the user. The later enables the easy modeling
            of the relations between elements.</p>

          <p>Modo language does not contain any built-in elements. However, built-in elements can be defined in different syntaxes
            of Modo, which are designed for different technologies.</p>

          <p>In lines 3, 4, 9, 10 and 14 the built-in element <span class="spanCodeBit">String</span> is used, where in line
            18 the user-defined element <span class="spanCodeBit">Instructor</span> is used as the type of the member element.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container" id="divElementTypeElementValue">
          <h2>Element Type vs. Element Value</h2>
          <p>When there is a need to access the value of a certain member element, a dollar symbol ($) is placed preceding the
            element name.</p>
          <div class="divCodePreview">
            <code>
                <pre style="background:#fff;color:#3b3b3b"><span style="color:#af82d4">/* Student Element Declaration */</span>
Student {
    Name <span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">=</span> String;
    Surname <span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">=</span> String;
    ID <span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">=</span> Number;
    GPA <span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">=</span> Number;

}
</pre>
            </code>
          </div>

          <p>In the above example the type of the <span class="spanCodeBit">Fullname</span> member element is <span class="spanCodeBit">String</span>.
            However the value of the element is a string combination of the values of the member elements <span class="spanCodeBit">Name</span>            and <span class="spanCodeBit">Surname</span>. This shows that at any time, the value of the fullname property
            of a student is his/her name, surname and a single space in between them.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container" id="divExtendElements">
          <h2>Extend Your Elements</h2>

          <p>In the above example a new element <span class="spanCodeBit">Advisor</span> is defined. The advisor is in fact
            an <span class="spanCodeBit">Instructor</span> but an additional property of office day is added.</p>

          <p>The member elements can also be extended like the elements.</p>

          <h1>Motivation</h1>
          <p>Information technologies provide solutions to make our lives easier. Some of them have little effect on our daily
            and profesional lives, where some can completely change them. Even further, internet makes these solutions, time
            and location free.</p>

          <p>This rapidly changing world of IT, emerges the need of robust, flexible and efficient software development methods
            and paradigms. These methods and paradigms should be easy to use, implement and integrate. In addition, these
            methods and paradigms should have the ability to adapt to the rapidly changing needs and technologies. Numerous
            studies have been made and several methods have been proposed. Today, these methods are being used by many of
            the professioanls of the IT and related fields.</p>

          <p>However the complex nature of the current methods requires technical knowledge in depth. This technical depth widens
            the gap between IT and the non-IT professionals.</p>

          <p>Moreover, with the increasing shift of systems to the online world, there still resides a need to have a semantic
            representation tool to model and convert real life systems to the world of computers.</p>

          <p>In order to address the above issues and more, we propose the Modo language.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="container" id="divWhatisModo">
          <h1>What is Modo?</h1>
          <p>
            Modo is an easy-to-use modeling language which is used for modeling systems, their subsystems, super systems (the system
            that encompasses the system that is in focus) and environment. The simple syntax of Modo allows easy modeling
            for not only the IT professionals but also for the professionals from non-IT fields. The well-structured and
            machine-readable nature of Modo also allows direct conversion of the models to different programming languages
            and technologies, thus serving as a technology independent modeling method.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container" id="divBriefHistory">
          <h1>Brief History</h1>
          <p>A significant part of software development can be described as an effort of modeling real-life systems, using the
            computer systems. Computer systems, which are more static, have structured (explicitly definite) or semi-structured
            nature. On the other hand real-life systems, which are more dynamic, can be structured, semi-structured or most
            of the time, unstructured.</p>

          <p>In the year 2005, a concept for software development was proposed by Aykut Aydınlı to be used for the projects
            of Sanpark. The main idea of this concept was to isolate the analysis and the design of real-life systems from
            the boundaries of computer systems. With the help of this isolated analysis, the idle effort of modeling an unstructured
            real-life system into a computer system is avoided and the resulting computer system serves as a complete solution.
            Ensuring the computer system is designed for the real-life system; not vice-versa.</p>

          <p>The isolated analysis needs a method to model and define the real-life system. First real-life system definition
            was made using XML in the late 2005. This definition enabled isolated analysis of real-life systems, automated
            conversion to existing technologies, and initiated real-life system versioning. This first definition syntax
            was used by Sanpark for two years.</p>

          <p>In late 2007, after observing the short-comings of the previous syntax a new language, which does not use the XML
            syntax anymore, has been constructed for system definition and semantic representation. And there the Modo language
            was born. There were two main reasons for abandoning the XML syntax:</p>

          <ol class="collection">
            <li class="collection-item">XML syntax is not easily readable/writable for non-IT professionals and</li>
            <li class="collection-item">XML is not sufficient to declare systems' different conditions, modes and states for different time frames and/or
              conditions.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>Modo's latest shape was given and the language specification was finalized by Aykut Aydınlı and Doruk Eker in June,
            2009.
          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="container" id="divTheNameModo">
          <h1>The Name Modo</h1>
          <p>The word "modo" means "mode" in Esperanto language. Esperanto language is a constructed (artificial) language.
            It is constructed to narrow the gap between people speaking different languages, having different cultures and
            having different beliefs.
          </p>
          <p>Similarly Modo language is constructed to narrow the gap between people from different disciplines, different technical
            expertise and different viewpoints.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container" id="divZeroDefect">
          <h1>The Zero Defect Software</h1>
          <p>From a certain point of view, a software which is not serving the needs of the user can be considered as defected.
            This can be caused by one or both reasons listed below:</p>

          <ol class="collection">
            <li class="collection-item">There are coding errors (bugs) within the code of the software.</li>
            <li class="collection-item">The real-life system/problem related to the software was poorly or never analyzed, therefore the resulting computer
              system fails to serve the real-life system.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>One should overcome the above issues to get closer to the zero-defect software phenomenon.</p>

          <p>The first type of errors are the runtime errors, namely the bugs in the software. At every line of code developed,
            there is a certain probability of having something wrong. Therefore as the number of lines of code developed
            for a project/software increases, the probability of having an error also increases. Reducing the number of lines
            of code developed specifically for a software project reduces the number of errors. Code generators enable the
            reduction in number of lines of code. Once the initial bugs in the generator are fixed, in unit time the generated
            code becomes bug-free.</p>

          <p>Modo is designed to be well-structured and machine readable, and therefore it is possible to use generators to
            convert Modo models to different languages. With the help of this feature Modo addresses the runtime errors.</p>

          <p>The second type of errors is the design-time errors which are basically the errors that occur when analyzing the
            systems. The quality of the system analysis is directly related with the experience of the analyzer. However,
            even for the inexperienced analyzer, the design-time errors can be fixed with trial and error. The trial and
            error method can only be efficient if the time needed for each trial is affordable. The simple syntax of Modo
            combined with the rapid code generation, decreases the time needed to try different scenarios. Therefore enabling

          <h1>Semantic Web and Modo</h1>
          <p>Every moment information technologies yield a large amount of information waiting for humans and systems to discover,
            filter, process and generate. As the amount of information increases, we have drastically less time to discover,
            filter and process this information. For this reason, no matter how precise and accurate a piece of information
            is, it starts to become meaningless, unless its meaning and relations can be understood and processed automatically
            by computers. Adding the meaning to any piece of information at its very source is the key solution for this
            problem. This ensures that the information is in the same format at any point of the system, hence the effort
            of all semantic web standards and specifications.
          </p>
          <p>A system which is modeled using Modo, is automatically represented at the semantic level. Different Modo models
            can include the required metadata for every piece of information to be delivered. This approach of Modo is aimed
            to be a contribution for the ongoing search of a common semantic definition method.

          <p>By reducing the time and cost of the solutions of real life problems, information technologies had a deep impact
            on the every little aspect of both our professional and daily lives. Especially with the urge of the internet
            era, this impact is drastically increasing as the solutions now became time-free and location-free (<a href="../../go.to/documentation/appendix_b">Park and Lim, 1999</a>;
            <a href="../../go.to/documentation/appendix_b">Calvary et al., 2003</a>; <a href="../../go.to/documentation/appendix_b">Rau et al., 2004</a>;

          <p>One of the largest challenges of the IT field is the gap between the real world systems and their representations
            in the computer, or to be more specific today's online world. Numerous professionals proposed notations, languages
            and methods to provide solutions to narrow this gap (<a href="../../go.to/documentation/appendix_b">Kernighan and Ritchie, 1978</a>;
            <a href="../../go.to/documentation/appendix_b">Wirth, 1971</a>; <a href="../../go.to/documentation/appendix_b">Gosling et al., 2005</a>;

            <a href="../../go.to/documentation/appendix_b">; Schwabe and Rossi, 1998</a>). Most of those solutions are being
            used by many of the IT and related professionals today.</p>
          <p>However, with the increasing shift of systems to the online world there still resides a need to have a representation
            tool to model and convert real life systems to the world of computers.</p>
          <p>Considering the online world of today and the predicted integrated and semantic, structure of tomorrow, one can

        <div class="container" id="divMotivation">
          <h1>Motivation</h1>
          <p>The basic idea that initiated the effort for the development of Modo was to create a modeling tool, which is able
            to model a real life system, its elements and the relations between them.</p>

          <p>Modo focuses on the system to be modeled, as it exists. The technological boundaries and constraints, which are
            only obstacles of the computer systems, are neglected during the modeling process. The model then can be converted
            to the required technologies. This conversion can be designed to catalyze any software development process, reducing
            the cycle time of development/maintenance and increasing the quality of the software.</p>

          <p>Moreover, Modo is aimed to be a contribution for the ongoing studies for the Semantic Web, which is considered
            to be the next era of online information delivery (<a href="../../go.to/documentation/appendix_b">Berners-Lee  et al., 2001</a>).
            Modo models represent entities of real life systems and the relations between them. Thus the system is modeled
            at the semantic level, and more importantly this model is completely machine-readable. With the help of this
            property, Modo can act as a common definition language at semantic level and help different systems (online/offline)
            to be integrated.</p>

          <p>All those properties of the language led us to show the effort to develop Modo.</p>

          <h1>Structure And Syntax</h1>
          <p>This chapter describes the basic structure of the Modo language. Additionally Modo syntax is introduced in this
            chapter.
          </p>
          <h2>Syntax</h2>
          <p>This section defines the Modo syntax. Besides some fundamental differences, Modo syntax shows similarities to Cascading
            Style Sheets (CSS) language specified in Bos et al. (<a href="../../go.to/documentation/appendix_b">Bos et al., 2009</a>).
            The reasons for these similarities are 1) CSS provides great ease for the definition of the elements and their
            properties and 2) common use of CSS language among different disciplines, especially designers and developers.</p>

          <p>Modo syntax is defined using Extended BNF metalanguage specified in ISO/IEC 14977 (<a href="../../go.to/documentation/appendix_b">ISO/IEC 14977, 1996</a>).
            By using the Extended BNF metalanguage, syntactic sequence of the Modo is separated into lexical units. This
            helps to identify every lexical unit in a meaningful Modo sentence.</p>

          <p>These definitions include some of the main syntactic parts of the Modo language. For the complete list of definitions,
            please refer to <a href="../../go.to/documentation/appendix_a">Appendix  A. Grammar</a>.</p>

          <p>Following example shows the declaration of an element in Modo syntax:</p>
          <!-- Code preview card -->
          <div class="divCodePreview">
            <code>
                <pre style="background:#fff;color:#3b3b3b"><span style="color:#af82d4">/* Company Element Declaration */</span>
  Company {
      Name <span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">=</span> String;
      <span style="color:#0053ff;font-weight:700">$Name</span> <span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">=</span> <span style="color:#666">"Doe Software Inc."</span>;

  }
                  </pre>
              </code>
          </div>
          <p>The example above shows the declaration of <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">Company</span> element.
            On line 1, a descriptive comment is added to the declaration. On line 2, the declaration of the Company element
            starts.
          </p>

          <p>On lines 3, 5 and 7 the member elements, <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">Name</span>, <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">Founder</span>            and <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">TaxNumber</span> of the <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">Company</span>            element are declared respectively. On lines 4, 6 and 8 initial values of those member elements are assigned.
            Please note that the
            <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">dollar  symbol &quot;$&quot;</span> preceding the member element
            name refers to the value of that member element.</p>

          <p>Finally on line 9, <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">Company</span> element declaration ends with
            <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">end declaration symbol &quot;}&quot;</span>.
          </p>

          <blockquote cite="">
            <strong>Note</strong>: The above example assumes that the element <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">String</span>            has already been defined.
          </blockquote>

          <h2>Tokenization</h2>
          <p>For better understanding, Modo syntax is separated into tokens at lexical level. A Modo declaration consists of
            a sequence of these tokens.
          </p>

          <p>Following is the general Extended BNF notation of the Modo:</p>
          <div class="divCodePreview">
            <code>
                <pre style="background:#fff;color:#3b3b3b">modo <span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">=</span> { 
    directive | rule | declaration | comment
  };
                </pre>
              </code>
          </div>
          <p>As you can see above, Modo definition consists of directives, rules, declarations and comments. Followings are
            the Extended BNF notations of each token:
          </p>
          <div class="divCodePreview">

          <h2>Rules</h2>
          <p>In Modo syntax, <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">Rules</span> play an important role of representing
            the different states of a system. In real life, the elements of a system might contain different properties or
            values for different states of the system. When modeling the system, those different states, values and properties
            must be included in the model. In Modo syntax, those different properties and values are reflected using the
            Rules.
          </p>

          <p>Declarations, types and the values of the elements can be specified depending on rules. With the help of rules,
            values and properties of the system can be changed or set depending on one or more conditions. Rules start with
            <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">at symbol &quot;@&quot;</span>.</p>

          <p>There are two types of rules: 1) Rule blocks and 2) inline rules. Following is the Extended BNF notation of rules
            (rule blocks) and inline rules:</p>

          <p>Imagine a scenario where the company's name was changed to <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">&quot;DOE Corp.&quot;</span>            in the year 2008. Therefore, once the value of the <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">CurrentYear</span>            is greater than 2008 the value of the <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">Name</span> element is

          <p>The example above shows the use of rule blocks. On line 6, rule block starts with <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">at symbol &quot;@&quot;</span>.
            On line 7, a new value is assigned to the <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">Name</span> element.

          <p>One possible implementation of <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">Rules</span> in Modo syntax is
            to define a value or property of elements that does not change in any state of the system.</p>

          <p>For the previous scenario, assume that the tax number of the company is always the same. Therefore, value of the
            <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">TaxNumber</span> element never changes. The following example
            shows the Modo syntax, which defines an everlasting rule.</p>
          <div class="divCodePreview">
            <code>
                <pre style="background:#fff;color:#3b3b3b">Company {

          <p>In the above example, the elements are defined similarly to the previous example. However, when assigning values
            a rule is defined for the value of the <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">TaxNumber</span> element.
            On line 7, after the value is assigned to the <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">TaxNumber</span>            element the rule <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">(1)</span> is defined. This rule indicates
            that, for all states of the system the value of the <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">TaxNumber</span>            element is <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">&quot;123456789987654321&quot;</span>.</p>
          <blockquote cite="">

          </blockquote>
          <h2>Blocks</h2>
          <p>Blocks are used for element and rule declarations. In Modo syntax, blocks start with <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">start declaration symbol &quot;{&quot;</span>            and end with <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">end declaration symbol &quot;}&quot;</span> (
            <a href="../../go.to/documentation/appendix_a">Appendix A. Grammar</a>). Every <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">start  declaration symbol </span>must
            end with <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">end declaration  symbol</span>.</p>

          <p>Similarly, in string values if a string starts with <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">single quote symbol</span>,
            it must end with <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">single  quote symbol</span>. In addition,
            if a string starts with <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">double quote symbol</span>, it must
            end with <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">double  quote symbol</span>. Every expression that
            starts with
            <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">start group symbol &quot;(&quot;</span> likewise ends with
            <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">end group symbol &quot;)&quot;</span>.</p>
          <h2>Selectors</h2>
          <p>Modo syntax provides some pattern-matching rules for element and member element declarations. These pattern-matching
            rules are called &quot;Selectors&quot;.</p>
          <p>Modo syntax introduces selectors conceptually. For further information, please refer to <a href="../../go.to/documentation/selectors">Selectors</a>.</p>
          <h2>Elements</h2>
          <p>Elements are the basic Modo structures that define real life entities. Elements can be declared by single line
            definitions or block declarations.</p>
          <p>Following example shows the declaration of <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">Company</span> element.</p>

          <p><strong>Assignments</strong> are one-line declarations where the assignment symbol &quot;=&quot; is used and values
            are assigned to the elements and member elements.</p>
          <p><strong>Basic declarations </strong>are the typical element declarations as blocks.</p>

            is specified by an expression. According to this expression, value of the <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">FullName</span>            member element is composed of the value of the <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">FirstName</span>            member element, the <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">space character &quot; &quot;</span> and
            the value of the <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">LastName</span> member element.
          </p>
          <p>Modo declarations specify the state of the system for the given time periods. This nature of the Modo necessitates
            that the assignments must be valid for the given time periods. Therefore, for the above example, when the FirstName
            attribute value changes, FullName attribute value must be recalculated and updated by the generators/compilers/interpreters
            using this Modo model.

          <h2>Values</h2>
          <p>There are two types of values in Modo syntax.</p>

          <ul type="square" class="collection">

            <li class="collection-item">Numeric values (integers and real numbers)</li>

            <li class="collection-item">Strings</li>

          </ul>

          <p>All the element or member element values must be specified using either numeric values or strings.</p>

          <h5>Integers and real numbers</h5>

          <p>Integers and real numbers are formed by bringing digits [0-9] together.</p>

          <p>Following is the Extended BNF notation of <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">integer</span> and
            <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">constant</span> (real number) syntax:</p>

          <div class="divCodePreview">
            <code>
                <pre style="background:#fff;color:#3b3b3b"><span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">integer</span> = <span style="color:#666">"0"</span> | (digit - <span style="color:#666">"0"</span>, {digit})<span style="color:#af82d4">;</span>

              </code>
          </div>
          <p>The syntax above shows that constant (real number) values include integer values. Decimal digits are separated
            using <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">dot  symbol &quot;.&quot;</span>.
          </p>
          <h2>Strings</h2>
          <p>Except numerals, all the values in Modo declarations must be specified as strings. Strings start with <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">single quote  symbol</span>            or <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">double quote</span> symbol and end with <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">single quote symbol</span>            or <span class="light light-blue-text text-accent-4">double quote symbol</span> respectively. Following examples
            show the different use of strings:

          <h1>Elements</h1>
          <p>Modo is used for describing systems. For better understanding, the system, its subsystems, its super system (the
            system that encompasses the system that is in focus), its environment and context can be separated into meaningful
            pieces. This approach has different names for different disciplines (e.g. Systems approach, object-oriented design).
            This approach is handy for analyzing and modeling systems. Sharing the same point of view, Modo offers separation
            of systems into signicifant unique pieces for modeling. These pieces are called "Elements" in Modo syntax. This
            chapter gives information about the declaration and usage of elements in Modo syntax.
          </p>
          <h2>Declerations</h2>
          <p>Declarations are used for representing the real-life system entities as Modo elements. There are three types of
            declarations:
          </p>

          <ol class="collection">
            <li class="collection-item">Assignments</li>
            <li class="collection-item">Basic Declarations</li>
            <li class="collection-item">Extended declarations</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Following sections give detailed information about declarations.</p>

          <h2>Assignments</h2>
          <p>Real-Life entities can have properties and sub elements. In Modo, these properties and sub elements are called
            &quot;Member Elements&quot;.
          </p>

          <p>Declaration of the elements can be made by assigning values to the member elements. In the following example assignments
            are used to declare the Company element.
          </p>
          <div class="divCodePreview">
            <code>
              <pre style="background:#fff;color:#3b3b3b">
Company Name = String<span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">;</span>
Company Founder = String<span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">;</span>
Company TaxNumber = String<span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">;</span>
Company <span style="color:#0053ff;font-weight:700">$Name</span> = <span style="color:#666">"Doe Software Inc."</span><span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">;</span>
Company <span style="color:#0053ff;font-weight:700">$Founder</span> = <span style="color:#666">"John Doe"</span><span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">;</span>
Company <span style="color:#0053ff;font-weight:700">$TaxNumber</span> = <span style="color:#666">"123456789987654321"</span><span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">;</span>
</pre>
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>The example above shows the declaration of Company element. On line 1, <span class="spanCodeBit">Name</span> attribute
            is defined and on line 4 the value <span class="spanCodeBit">&quot;Doe  Software Co.,Ltd.&quot;</span> is assigned.
            On line 2, <span class="spanCodeBit">Founder</span> attribute is defined and on line 5, the value <span class="spanCodeBit">&quot;John  Doe&quot;</span>            is assigned. Finally, on line 3, <span class="spanCodeBit">TaxNumber</span> attribute is defined and on line
            6, the value <span class="spanCodeBit">&quot;123456789987654321&quot;</span> is assigned.
          </p>
          <h2>Extended Declerations</h2>
          <p>Element declarations can be made by extending built-in or previously defined elements. The extended element carries
            all the properties of the parent element. Additionally, extended element can have its original member elements.
          </p>

          <p>Following are the basic declarations of the <span class="spanCodeBit">Worker</span> element and the <span class="spanCodeBit">Developer</span>            element which extends the <span class="spanCodeBit">Worker</span> element:</p>
          <div class="divCodePreview">
            <code>
                <pre style="background:#fff;color:#3b3b3b">Worker {
    Name = String;
    Surname = String;
    Department = String;
}
                </pre>
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>The above example is the basic declaration of the <span class="spanCodeBit">Worker</span> element. On line 1, the
            declaration of the element starts. On lines 2, 3 and 4, the member elements <span class="spanCodeBit">Name</span>,
            <span class="spanCodeBit">Surname</span> and <span class="spanCodeBit">Department</span> are defined respectively.
          </p>
          <div class="divCodePreview">
            <code>
                <pre style="background:#fff;color:#3b3b3b">Developer = Worker {
    <span style="color:#0053ff;font-weight:700">$Department</span> = <span style="color:#666">"Software Development"</span><span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">;</span>
    Expertise = String<span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">;</span>
}
                </pre>
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>On line 1, <span class="spanCodeBit">Developer</span> element is declared extending the <span class="spanCodeBit">Worker</span>            element. With this assignment, extended declaration of the <span class="spanCodeBit">Developer</span> element
            starts. On line 2, a value, <span class="spanCodeBit">&quot;Software Development&quot;</span>, is assigned to
            the <span class="spanCodeBit">Department</span> element. In the above example the <span class="spanCodeBit">Department</span>            element belongs to the <span class="spanCodeBit">Worker</span> element. So in line 2, the Developer element extends
            the <span class="spanCodeBit">Worker</span> element via assigning a value to an existing member element. However
            in line 3, a new member element <span class="spanCodeBit">Expertise</span>, which belongs only to <span class="spanCodeBit">Developer</span>            element, is defined. So this time, the <span class="spanCodeBit">Worker</span> element is extended via defining
            a new member element.
          </p>
          <h2>Using Elements</h2>
          <p>Declaration process of the Modo elements is not limited to specifying the member elements, but it also includes
            relating them with each other and other Modo elements. This section gives details about using elements.
          </p>
          <h2>Member Elements</h2>
          <p>In Modo syntax, all the properties/attributes of an element are also elements, which are called member elements.
            Member element declaration starting without any preceding characters, defines the type of the member element.
            The type of the member elements can be a built-in or previously declared element.</p>

          <p>When the definition of the member element starts with the <span class="spanCodeBit">dollar symbol &quot;$&quot;</span>,
            this assignment specifies the initial value of this element in the system. If the initial value is assigned with
            a rule, then that value will be condition dependent.</p>

          <p>Following is the Modo declaration of the <span class="spanCodeBit">Company</span> element:</p>
          <div class="divCodePreview">
            <code>
                <pre style="background:#fff;color:#3b3b3b">Company {
    Name = String<span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">;</span>
    <span style="color:#0053ff;font-weight:700">$Name</span> = <span style="color:#666">"Doe Software Inc."</span><span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">;</span>
    <span style="color:#0053ff;font-weight:700">$Name</span> = <span style="color:#666">"DOE Corp."</span> @ (<span style="color:#0053ff;font-weight:700">$CurrentYear</span> <span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">></span> 2008)<span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">;</span>
    Founder = String<span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">;</span>
    <span style="color:#0053ff;font-weight:700">$Founder</span> = <span style="color:#666">"John Doe"</span><span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">;</span>
    TaxNumber = String<span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">;</span>
    <span style="color:#0053ff;font-weight:700">$TaxNumber</span> = <span style="color:#666">"123456789987654321"</span><span style="color:#069;font-weight:700">;</span>  
}
                </pre>
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>In the above example, on lines 2, 5 and 7, the member elements <span class="spanCodeBit">Name</span>, <span class="spanCodeBit">Founder</span>            and <span class="spanCodeBit">TaxNumber</span> are declared respectively. Their types are also specified as
            <span class="spanCodeBit">String</span>, which is another built-in or previously declared element. On lines,
            3, 6 and 8 initial values are assigned with the help of <span class="spanCodeBit">dollar symbol &quot;$&quot;</span>.
            On line 4, a different value is assigned to the <span class="spanCodeBit">Name</span> member element, but this
            time depending on a rule <span class="spanCodeBit">($CurrentYear &gt; 2008)</span>.</p>

          <p>Modo syntax also allows nested declarations where the member elements can extend an existing element. This nested
            declaration is one of the ways to define the relationship between the elements.</p>

          <p>Following examples shows the nested declaration of member elements: </p>

            </code>
          </div>
          <p>The example above shows the declaration of the <span class="spanCodeBit">Worker</span> element. On lines 2, 3 and

            </code>
          </div>
          <p>The above example shows the declaration of the <span class="spanCodeBit">Department</span> element. On line 2,
            <span class="spanCodeBit">DepartmentName</span> member element is declared. On line 3, member element <span class="spanCodeBit">Manager</span>            is declared extending the element <span class="spanCodeBit">Worker</span>. On line 4, the value of the
            <span class="spanCodeBit">Department</span> member element of the <span class="spanCodeBit">Manager</span> element
            is assigned to the value of the <span class="spanCodeBit">DepartmentName</span> member element.
          </p>
          <h2>Accessing Member Elements</h2>
          <p>The value of built-in elements, previously declared elements or member elements could be used while declaring the

          <p>Left-hand side selectors have more complex structure than right-hand side selectors. The Extended BNF notation

            Additionally, it is possible to specify more than one <span class="spanCodeBit">lhs selector </span>by separating

          <h2>Universial Selector</h2>
          <p>In Modo selector syntax, <span class="spanCodeBit">&quot;*&quot;</span> symbol plays an important role. This symbol
            is called <span class="spanCodeBit">universal  selector </span>and used to match any single element. As specified
            in <a href="../../go.to/documentation/appendix_a">Appendix  A. Grammar</a>,<span class="spanCodeBit"> universal  selector</span>            can only be used in left-hand side selectors. The main reason for this convention is, right-hand side selectors
            are not allowed to address more than one element.
          </p>
          <h2>Grouping</h2>
          <p>Modo syntax provides grouping for left-hand side selectors. Left-hand side selectors may specify more than one
            element at a time. This is useful for declaring identical elements.
          </p>
          <blockquote class="blockImportant">
            <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Grouping can only be used on left-hand side selectors. Right-hand side selectors have

An <span class="spanCodeBit">operand</span>            or <span class="spanCodeBit">expression</span> follows this symbol.

          <h2>Operators</h2>
          <p>As mentioned in expression syntax, expressions are composed of operands and operators. Operators specify the operations
            that will be applied to the operands (<a href="../../go.to/documentation/appendix_b">ECMA-334, 2006</a>).</p>

          <p>In Modo syntax, there are two types of operators:</p>

          <ol class="collection">
            <li class="collection-list"><strong>Unary operators</strong> take one operand (e.g. -A, A++).</li>
            <li class="collection-list"><strong>Binary operators</strong> take two operands (e.g. A + B).</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Following is the Extended BNF notation of <span class="spanCodeBit">unary operator </span>and <span class="spanCodeBit">operator</span>            (Binary operator) in Modo syntax:</p>

          <p>First column specifies the priority of the operator. Unary operators have the highest priority (1) and conditional
            OR operator has the lowest (11) one. Second column specifies the category of the operator. Finally, third column

          <h2>Unary Operators</h2>
          <p>Unary operators have the highest priority. These operators consist of:</p>
          <ol class="collection">
            <li class="collection-item">
              <strong>Unary plus operator</strong> is used to form an operation like <span class="spanCodeBit">+A</span>.
              This operation results simply the value of the operand.
            </li>
            <li class="collection-item">
              <strong>Unary minus operator</strong> is used to form an operation like <span class="spanCodeBit">-A</span>.

            </li>
            <li class="collection-item">
              <strong>Negation operator</strong> is used to form an operation like <span class="spanCodeBit">!A</span>. This

          <h2 id="op6">Equality Operators</h2>
          <p>"==" and "!=" operators are used for equality operations. Equality operators consists of:</p>

          <ol class="collection">
            <li class="collection-item">
              <strong>&quot;Equal to&quot; operator</strong> is used to form an operation like <span class="spanCodeBit">A == B</span>.
              If the value of the operand <span class="spanCodeBit">A</span> is equal to the value of the operand <span class="spanCodeBit">B</span>,
              <span class="spanCodeBit">A == B</span> operation yields the logical true value.
            </li>
            <li class="collection-item">
              <strong>&quot;Not equal to&quot;  operator</strong> is used to form an operation like <span class="spanCodeBit">A != B</span>.
              The <span class="spanCodeBit">A != B</span> operation is logically negative to the operation <span class="spanCodeBit">A == B</span>.
              If the value of he operand <span class="spanCodeBit">A</span> is not equal to the value of the operand
              <span class="spanCodeBit">B</span>, <span class="spanCodeBit">A != B</span> operation yields the logical true
              value.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2 id="op7">Logical AND Operator</h2>
          <p>Logical <span class="spanCodeBit">AND</span> operator is used to form an operation like<span class="spanCodeBit"> A &amp; B</span>.
            This operation results the bitwise logical <span class="spanCodeBit">AND</span> of the operands <span class="spanCodeBit">A</span>            and <span class="spanCodeBit">B</span>.</p>

          <h2 id="op8">Logical XOR Operator</h2>
          <p>Logical <span class="spanCodeBit">XOR</span> operator is used to form an operation like <span class="spanCodeBit">A ^ B</span>.
            This operation results the bitwise logical exclusive OR of the operands <span class="spanCodeBit">A</span> and
            <span class="spanCodeBit">B</span>.
          </p>

          <h2 id="op9">Logical OR operator</h2>
          <p>Logical OR operator is used to form an operation like <span class="spanCodeBit">A | B</span>. This operation results
            the bitwise logical OR of the operands <span class="spanCodeBit">A</span> and <span class="spanCodeBit">B</span>.
          </p>

          <h2 id="op10">Conditional AND operator</h2>
          <p>Conditional AND operator is used to form an operation like <span class="spanCodeBit">A &amp;&amp; B</span>. This
            operation results the coditional AND of the operands <span class="spanCodeBit">A</span> and <span class="spanCodeBit">B</span>.
          </p>

          <h2 id="op11">Conditional OR operator</h2>
          <p>Conditional OR operator is used to form an operation like <span class="spanCodeBit">A || B</span>. This operation
            results the conditional OR of the operands <span class="spanCodeBit">A</span> and <span class="spanCodeBit">B</span>.
          </p>

          <h2 id="constants_and_strings">Constants and strings</h2>
          <p>Constant numeric values and strings can be used as operands in expressions. </p>

          <p>Following is the Extended BNF notation of <span class="spanCodeBit">constant</span> and <span class="spanCodeBit">string</span>            in Modo syntax:</p>

          <div class="divCodePreview">

          <p>The <span class="spanCodeBit">constant</span> definition above shows that only the numeric values are considered
            as constants. A <span class="spanCodeBit">constant</span> can be integer or real number. Decimal part of the
            number starts with <span class="spanCodeBit">dot symbol &quot;.&quot;</span>. Just like integer and real number
            which are numeric constants, <span class="spanCodeBit">string</span> is the alphanumeric constant.

          <h2>Elements and member elements</h2>
          <p>Elements and member elements can be considered as operands in Modo expressions.</p>
          <p>For further information about elements and member elements, please refer to <a href="../../go.to/documentation/elements">Using elements</a>.</p>

          <h2>Functions and member methods</h2>
          <p>Unlike C, C++, C#, Java etc., function and/or method definition is not allowed in Modo syntax. Modo represents
            and forms the system and its states for the given time periods and for the given set of rules. Nevertheless,
            there can be built-in elements, functions and member methods defined in Modo language references specific for
            certain generators/compilers/interpreters. These built-in elements, functions and member methods can also be
            considered as operands in Modo expressions.
